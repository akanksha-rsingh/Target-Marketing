# Target-Marketing
Abstract:There  are  two  main  approaches  to  enterprise  marketing:  (1)  mass  campaigns,  targeting  several general  customers,  or  (2)  directed  marketing,  targeting  a  specific  set  of  customers.  In  this  competitive world, the  mass  campaign strategy is  not very productive. Nevertheless, there  are  challenges to directed marketing:  finding  potential  customers  is  not  very  easy,  although  data  mining  (DM)  techniques  are providing some assistance in that regard. The given dataset is from a Portuguese banking institution and was used in their direct marketing campaign to sell term deposits to their customers. You can think of it as cross-selling. The campaign was mostly  based  on  phone  calls  and  the  dataset  stores  general  information  about  customers,  details  of contacts made with them and the output variable ywhich indicates whether a term deposit was subscribed to by the customer or not. There are two datasets –1. PortugueseBank Data –TRAIN, and 2. PortugueseBank Data -TEST
